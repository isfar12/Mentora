They involve many d evices, protocols, and software/hardware working together. To manage this complexity: • Tasks are divided into layers • Each layer handles a specific function • Layers communicate with their counterparts on another device Layered Tasks Imagine sending a letter: • You write it → Give to delivery boy → Post office processes it → Truck delivers In networks: • Each layer handles a similar step.

The dependence of core flux on the preceding flux history and the resulting failure to retrace flux paths is known as hysteresis loss. Due to hysteresis, the value of core flux is nonzero when the input current becomes zero. This is known as residual flux.

This group of magnetically aligned atoms is called a domain. Each domain is a separate entity; that is, each domain is independent of the surrounding domains.

The extra atoms aligned with the fi eld increase the magnetic flux in the iron, which in turn causes more atoms to switch orientation, further increasing the strength of the magnetic field.

Originally, energy was provided by the external magnetic field to accomplish the alignment; when the field is removed, there is no source of energy to cause all the domains to rotate back. The piece of iron is now a permanent magnet. Once the domains are aligned, some of them will remain aligned until a source of external energy is supplied to change them. Examples of sources of external energy that can change the alignment of domains are magnetomotive force applied in another directio n, a large mechanical shock, and heating. Any of these events can impart energy to the domains and enable them to change alignment. (It is for this reason that a permanent magnet can lose its magnetism if it is dropped, hit with a',\n",

The hysteresis loss in an iron core is the energy required to accomplish the reorientation of domains during each cycle of the alternating current applied to the core. The area enclosed in the hysteresis loop formed by applying an alternating current to the core is directly proportional to the energy lost in a given ac cycle.

Energy is dissipated (in the form of heat) because these eddy currents are flowing in a resistive material (iron). The amount of energy lost to eddy curren ts is proportional to the size of the paths they follow within the core. To reduce energy loss, ferromagnetic core should be broken up into small strips, or laminations, and build the core up out of these strips.
